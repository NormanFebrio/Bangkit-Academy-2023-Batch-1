1. What is the difference between traditional programming and Machine Learning?
   - **In traditional programming, a programmer has to formulate or code rules manually, whereas, in Machine Learning, the algorithm automatically formulates the rules from the data.** *(correct)*
   - Machine learning identifies complex activities such as golf, while traditional programming is better suited to simpler activities such as walking.

2. What do we call the process of telling the computer what the data represents (i.e. this data is for walking, this data is for running)?
   - Learning the Data
   - Categorizing the Data
   - **Labelling the Data** *(correct)*
   - Programming the Data

3. What is a Dense layer?
   - An amount of mass occupying a volume
   - A single neuron
   - A layer of disconnected neurons
   - **A layer of connected neurons** *(correct)*

4. How do you measure how good the current ‘guess’ is?
   - **Using the Loss function** *(correct)*
   - Figuring out if you win or lose
   - Training a neural network

5. What does the optimizer do?
   - **Generates a new and improved guess** *(correct)*
   - Measures how good the current guess is
   - Decides to stop training a neural network
   - Figures out how to efficiently compile your code

6. What is Convergence?
   - An analysis that corresponds too closely or exactly to a particular set of data.
   - A programming API for AI
   - A dramatic increase in loss
   - **The process of getting very close to the correct answer** *(correct)*

7. What does model.fit do?
   - It makes a model fit available memory
   - It determines if your activity is good for your body
   - **It trains the neural network to fit one set of values to another** *(correct)*
   - It optimizes an existing model
